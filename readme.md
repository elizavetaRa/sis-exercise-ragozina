# Assignment: INSPIREHEP Search & Summarization Web App



## Setup Application 

### Backend
Prerequisites: Docker, Docker-compose
1. Rename ".env.example" file to ".env" and adjust
2. Setup
    * Run the django app 
    ```
        make up 
        make bootstrap 
        # visit localhost:8000
        # user: admin
        # password: admin
    ```
The backend app should run on http://localhost:8000/
To access admin view: go to http://localhost:8000/admin with *user* and *password *



### Celery Data Harvester

1. Run the backend
2. In another terminal copy the celery docker-container id by running 

``` docker ps```


4. Run celery worker 
```docker exec -it f <celery-docker-container-id> celery -A sis_exercise worker --loglevel=info```

5. Run celery beat
```docker exec -it <celery-docker-container-id> celery -A sis_exercise beat --loglevel=info```


The harvester will fill the db with the api results in the interval set in CELERY_SCHEDULE_MINUTES in *.env* file (1 day default)


### Frontend
Prerequisites: developed on node version v22.9.0
1. Rename .env.example to .env and adjust REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL if needed (default as above)
2. Go to frontend folder and run 
```npm install```
```npm start```

The frontend app should run on http://localhost:3000/

## Overview solution
The solution provides a simple web application that allows users to search for high-energy physics papers using the INSPIREHEP REST API and receive a summary generated by the OpenAI API and the list of results. The application consists of a Django backend and a React frontend.

- The celery harvester harvests everyday the INSPIREHEP REST API, gets the first 40 papers and saves them
-  The frontend UI provides an accessible search bar for the search queries and displays the OpenAI generated summary and the list of results
- The backend provides the endpoint for the search query,  extracts titles and abstracts from the top search results, summizes the information using the OpenAI API or a mock function and returns it with the search results

## Assumptions or shortcuts
- Publication date is not returned by the api for tested results but publication year. For the mocking of date assumed, the publication date is "01/01/year"
- Usage of ant.design for quick prototyping of the frontend






## Create a task description for the following request:
* The product owner wants to have metrics about the OPENAI API response time and the most common user queries.
    *  Create an issue for this task that you will give to your team to solve, please be specific.
       in the implementation.
    * OPTIONAL: Implement your suggestion.

### Task Description: Metrics for OPENAI API Response Time and User Queries
* Task Title: Implement Metrics for OPENAI API Performance and User Interaction

* User Story: As a product owner, I want to gather metrics about the OPENAI API response time and the most common user queries displayed in the Django admin view so that we can analyze it's performance.

* Acceptance Criteria:
    * Response Time Measurement:
Implement functionality to track the response time for each API call to the OPENAI API.
Log response times in milliseconds for each request.


* User Queries Tracking:
Capture and store all user queries and their counts sent to the OPENAI API.
    Ensure queries are logged with timestamps for tracking trends over time.
Data Aggregation:


* Reporting Dashboard:
Create a user-friendly dashboard in django admin panel that displays:
Real-time average response time metrics.
A list of the most common user queries along with their frequency.
* Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to log and report failed API requests separately.
* Documentation:
Provide clear documentation on:
How metrics are collected and reported.
Instructions for accessing and interpreting the dashboard.



* Definition of Done:
    - Code is implemented, tested, and reviewed.
    - The metrics are being logged and can be accessed in the Django admin view.
    - The admin dashboard displays accurate metrics.
    - Documentation is updated and accessible.
    - Metrics are being logged and can be accessed by the product owner.


- Sprint considerations: Estimate story points for this task and prioritize it in the upcoming sprint. After implementation, gather feedback from the product owner to refine metrics further.
